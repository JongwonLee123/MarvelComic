In these files, there is the index, script, and the style files.

The index html file contains the basic structure to allow the comics to be presented in an orderly fashion. The buttons allow the user to choose between the characters as the api fetches for that character.

The script.js file contains the api key, the hash, and the timestamp needed to call the API. After calling the API, data is stored into arrays that are later pushed into the comic ids in the html file. Console.log() was used often to test if the data was getting parsed through the functions and api call. Finally, I added a reset button that reset the page elements to match the new choice selected.

The style.css file contains basic cosmetic changes, but includes changes depending on the size of the screen using flex properties and the @media screen feature.

There is one image from the web used as the main background of the html file.
